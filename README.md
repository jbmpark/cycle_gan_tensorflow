cycle_gan  w/ tensorflow  ( Just proof of concept )


Just for PoC!

Used 'horse2zebra' dataset from 'https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow', great thanks! 
The above site provides with good and exact example, just simple is mine!

Do :

- download dataset
source download_dataset.sh horse2zebra
- adjust dataset folder
- set GPU number ( GPU variable in the cycle_gan.py )
run python cycle_gan.py
